# Machine Learning with Python (Physics-Oriented)

This repository presents a **research-oriented study of machine learning methods with explicit emphasis on applications in physics**, particularly **quantum systems, experimental data analysis, and computational modeling**.  
The focus is on understanding machine learning algorithms from a **theoretical and algorithmic perspective**, and on applying them to problems commonly encountered in modern physics research.

## Scientific Motivation

Machine learning has become an increasingly important tool in **quantum physics, condensed matter, quantum optics, and experimental data analysis**, where high-dimensional data, noise, and nonlinear dynamics are ubiquitous.

This repository aims to:
- Connect **statistical learning theory** with **physical modeling**
- Provide reproducible implementations suitable for **scientific data analysis**
- Develop intuition for algorithm behavior in **noisy and finite-data regimes**, typical of experiments
- Serve as a methodological bridge between **physics-based models** and **data-driven approaches**
